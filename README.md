**Simple app that converts ELK JSON formated log entries to readable stack trace.**
 
**Usage:**
- Build the project (once): mvn clean install
- Open src/main/resources/logentry.json and paste the JSON log entry (with curly brackets included).  
- Run the main() method: src/main/java/Formatter.java
- The stack trace will be printed in the std out.
